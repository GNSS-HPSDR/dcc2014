Title: Introduction to SoC FPGA Programming for Mixed Signal Systems

Abstract: The latest generation of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer an unprecedented level of integration, combining a full ARM processor with standard peripherals like USB and Ethernet on the same die as customizable logic. These Systems-on-a-Chip (or SoC's) are available from all major FPGA vendors, and they allow the hobbyist to hack together a state-of-the-art embedded system with all of the bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, all with minimal effort.

In this seminar we'll cover the structure of these SoC FPGA's, from a high level discussion, down to the nitty gritty of designing and interfacing custom logic to meet your needs. We'll start with the basics like state machines, and end with integrating and processing real-world, mixed signals. The perfect setup to start you off on your next software radio or robotics project. This is not a vendor tool tutorial - all of the tools used are 100% Open Source. You'll go home with a set of working example projects that simulate the full concert of an embedded SoC FPGA, ready for your imagination to run wild.
